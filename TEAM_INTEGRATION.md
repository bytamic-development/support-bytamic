# Team Section Integration - AnimatedTooltip Component

## ‚úÖ Integration Complete

Successfully integrated the AnimatedTooltip component to replace the "About Our Team" section.

## What Was Done

### 1. **Project Setup Verification**
- ‚úÖ TypeScript - Already configured
- ‚úÖ Tailwind CSS - Already configured  
- ‚úÖ Shadcn structure - `@/*` path aliases already set up
- ‚úÖ Component folder - `src/components/ui/` exists

### 2. **Dependencies Installed**
```bash
npm install framer-motion clsx tailwind-merge
```

### 3. **Files Created**

#### `/src/lib/utils.ts`
- Created the `cn()` utility function required by shadcn components
- Combines `clsx` and `tailwind-merge` for className management

#### `/src/components/ui/animated-tooltip.tsx`
- Main AnimatedTooltip component with framer-motion animations
- Adapted from Next.js to work with Vite (replaced `Image` with `img`)
- Features interactive hover tooltips with spring animations

#### `/src/components/ui/team-section.tsx`
- Team implementation using your actual team members:
  - Anna - Lead Support Services
  - Maciej - Lead Service Desk
  - S≈Çawomir - Lead IT Infrastructure
- Uses local team images from `/Team/` folder

### 4. **Integration Points**

#### Updated `/index.html` (line 1016)
- Replaced the static team grid with React mount point: `<div id="team-root">`

#### Updated `/src/main.tsx`
- Added TeamSection import and mount logic
- Mounted between Waves and Footer components

## Component Features

### Interactive Animations
- **Hover Effect**: Hover over team member avatars to see animated tooltips
- **Spring Physics**: Smooth spring-based animations with rotation and translation
- **Visual Effects**: Gradient underlines and backdrop blur effects

### Responsive Design
- Fully responsive component
- Works seamlessly with your existing design system
- Matches your brand colors (background #070707, primary #2f4200, accent #a9ed02)

## Testing

The dev server is running at: **http://localhost:3000**

Navigate to the "About" section to see the new animated team component in action!

## Technical Notes

### Why `src/components/ui/`?
This is the standard shadcn structure that:
- Keeps UI components organized and discoverable
- Makes it easy to add more shadcn components later
- Follows React best practices for component architecture

### Vite Adaptation
The original component used Next.js `Image` component. This was adapted to use standard HTML `<img>` tags since you're using Vite.

### Dependencies Explained
- **framer-motion**: Powers the smooth animations and spring physics
- **clsx**: Conditional className utility
- **tailwind-merge**: Intelligently merges Tailwind classes without conflicts

## Next Steps (Optional)

1. **Customize Animations**: Adjust spring config values in `animated-tooltip.tsx`
2. **Add More Details**: Extend the tooltip to show more information
3. **Update Team Info**: Modify designations in `team-section.tsx`
4. **Add More Team Members**: Simply add more objects to the `people` array
